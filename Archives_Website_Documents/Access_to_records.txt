RECORDS PRESERVED IN  STACKS 
There are Almirahs under lock and key system for keeping the Deeds of Mortgage, documents of Cooperative Societies, Agreements and Bonds in which State Government bodies are signatories. Tamil Nadu Archives, on requisition from the Government i.e., the Departments in the Secretariat, search and supply records for the administrative references.  The records sent for references are recalled and preserved. Copies of public records are issued to the public who apply under Right to Information Act(RTI) observing rules in force.  
INTERIM REPOSITORY RECORDS IN STACKS.
The Government Departments in the Secretariat often require the records of near past for their administrative references.  As only records more than 30 years only were stored in the Archives, from the year 1987, an interim repository was created in stack 2 and 5 where all the 30 years old records   (mostly Government Orders) were separated and preserved,  in order to store records less than 30 years.
Stack wise storage of records from various sources in Stack 1 to Stack 9 are as follows:

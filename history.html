    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(155, 188, 24); text-align: justify; max-width: 1000px; margin-left: 100px;">The earliest repository of Government records of the Madras Presidency was the Council Room in the Fort House at Chennai. In the year 1805, Lord William Bentinck, the then Governor of Madras, pooled the records of all the different departments by separating most important records and placed them under the charge of a Record Keeper.  Considering the importance of preserving Government records, in 1906, the Madras Council decided to build a special record room with fire proof and special fittings in a separate place.  The Government land “Grasmere” was identified for separate Record office in Egmore. On the orders of His Excellency the Governor, the Consultant Architect G.S.T. Harris, a Superintending Engineer in the Public Works Department, prepared and submitted plans for construction of building at an estimated cost of Rs.3,39,249-, which was accorded sanction by August 1907.  In the year 1909, the Madras Record Office, the precursor of Tamil Nadu Archives started functioning.  Since then all documents of administrative and social importance ranging from the East India Company regime to the present day administration of Tamil Nadu Government are being preserved by adopting various preservation methods. In the year 1973, the Madras Record Office was renamed as “Tamil Nadu Archives and Historical Research”.  The various activities of the T.N. Archives  as on date  carry historical and administrative significance to the future of Tamil Nadu.</h3>

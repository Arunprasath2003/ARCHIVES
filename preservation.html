    <h2>PRESERVATION DIVISION</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(24, 16, 108);">Preservation Division consists of skilled menders, who are now designated as Preservation Clerks and Binders. The work of mending of records was started in 1921 with 6 skilled menders. This marked the beginning of new era in the preservation aspect of record administration.  At present this division consists of 39 Preservation Clerks and 9 Binders. The records which are very brittle are being repaired with “Chiffon” a silk gauze and handmade paper. The repaired sheets are properly stitched and bound in the Binding Wing of this Division.
        Lamination Division carries out machine lamination of fragile and brittle papers with Cellulose acetate foil and tissue paper.  Laminated documents are supposed to last a century and can be relaminated and can be provided with fresh acetate foils and tissue paper, giving the record a fresh lease of life. 
        De acidification of records is done to remove the acidity in the paper before the records are taken up for mending and lamination.
        Fumigation Cabinet is the most effective process in exterminating insects, mildew (a fungus), etc., It secures 100% kill without any damage to the papers.  The records are fumigated in small wooden cabinets with para-di-chlore benzene. Naphthalene bricks are also kept on record shelves. 
                The whiteants extermination service to the entire building of this Archives is carried out through Tamil Nadu Warehousing Corporation to safeguard the record holdings.

    <h2>MICROFILM UNIT</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(24, 16, 108);">A Microfilm Unit has been installed in the Archives Office in 1982. A programme of microfilming of records has been drawn and the records are being microfilmed, which ensures authenticity of copying the original document.  Further, second line of defence is achieved by this and frequent handling of old records by the researchers is avoided.
